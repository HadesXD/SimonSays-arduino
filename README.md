# Simon Says game for Arduino

Arduino is fun microcontroller to mess around with, so I wanted to create an LED game for it. <br/>
I decided to create a Simon Says game for it. The project was pretty simple, I had to include a custom library for the music.<br/>

<b>Used:</b>
- language: C/C++
- IDE: ArduinoIDE
- Components: Arduino UNO, breadboard, 4 LEDs (red, blue, yellow, green), 4 resistors (120Ohms), 4 connectors
- Added library: https://github.com/bhagman/Tone
